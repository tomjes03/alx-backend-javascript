RxJS 6 Stable
MIGRATION AND RELEASE INFORMATION:
Find out how to update to v6, automatically update your TypeScript code, and more!

Current home is MIGRATION.md
FOR V 5.X PLEASE GO TO THE 5.0 BRANCH
Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript. This is a rewrite of Reactive-Extensions/RxJS and is the latest production-ready version of RxJS. This rewrite is meant to have better performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.

Installation and Usage
ES6 via npm
npm install rxjs
It's recommended to pull in the Observable creation methods you need directly from 'rxjs' as shown below with range. And you can pull in any operator you need from one spot, under 'rxjs/operators'.

import { range } from "rxjs";
import { map, filter } from "rxjs/operators";

range(1, 200)
  .pipe(
    filter(x => x % 2 === 1),
    map(x => x + x)
  )
  .subscribe(x => console.log(x));
Here, we're using the built-in pipe method on Observables to combine operators. See pipeable operators for more information.

CommonJS via npm
To install this library for CommonJS (CJS) usage, use the following command:

npm install rxjs
(Note: destructuring available in Node 8+)

const { range } = require('rxjs');
const { map, filter } = require('rxjs/operators');

range(1, 200).pipe(
  filter(x => x % 2 === 1),
  map(x => x + x)
).subscribe(x => console.log(x));
CDN
For CDN, you can use unpkg:

https://unpkg.com/rxjs/bundles/rxjs.umd.min.js

The global namespace for rxjs is rxjs:

const { range } = rxjs;
const { map, filter } = rxjs.operators;

range(1, 200)
  .pipe(
    filter(x => x % 2 === 1),
    map(x => x + x)
  )
  .subscribe(x => console.log(x));
Goals
Smaller overall bundles sizes
Provide better performance than preceding versions of RxJS
To model/follow the Observable Spec Proposal to the observable
Provide more modular file structure in a variety of formats
Provide more debuggable call stacks than preceding versions of RxJS
Building/Testing
npm run build_all - builds everything
npm test - runs tests
npm run test_no_cache - run test with ts-node set to false
Performance Tests
Run npm run build_perf or npm run perf to run the performance tests with protractor.

Run npm run perf_micro [operator] to run micro performance test benchmarking operator.

Adding documentation
We appreciate all contributions to the documentation of any type. All of the information needed to get the docs app up and running locally as well as how to contribute can be found in the documentation directory.

Generating PNG marble diagrams
The script npm run tests2png requires some native packages installed locally: imagemagick, graphicsmagick, and ghostscript.

For Mac OS X with Homebrew:

brew install imagemagick
brew install graphicsmagick
brew install ghostscript
You may need to install the Ghostscript fonts manually:
Download the tarball from the gs-fonts project
mkdir -p /usr/local/share/ghostscript && tar zxvf /path/to/ghostscript-fonts.tar.gz -C /usr/local/share/ghostscript
For Debian Linux:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dhor/myway
apt-get install imagemagick
apt-get install graphicsmagick
apt-get install ghostscript
For Windows and other Operating Systems, check the download instructions here:
