signal-exit
Build Status Coverage NPM version Standard Version

When you want to fire an event no matter how a process exits:

reaching the end of execution.
explicitly having process.exit(code) called.
having process.kill(pid, sig) called.
receiving a fatal signal from outside the process
Use signal-exit.

var onExit = require('signal-exit')

onExit(function (code, signal) {
  console.log('process exited!')
})
API
var remove = onExit(function (code, signal) {}, options)

The return value of the function is a function that will remove the handler.

Note that the function only fires for signals if the signal would cause the process to exit. That is, there are no other listeners, and it is a fatal signal.

Options
alwaysLast: Run this handler after any other signal or exit handlers. This causes process.emit to be monkeypatched.
