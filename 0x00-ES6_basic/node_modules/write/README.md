write NPM version NPM monthly downloads NPM total downloads Linux Build Status
Write data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists and creating any intermediate directories if they don't already exist. Thin wrapper around node's native fs methods.

Install
Install with npm:

$ npm install --save write
Usage
var writeFile = require('write');
API
writeFile
Asynchronously writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists and creating any intermediate directories if they don't already exist. Data can be a string or a buffer. Returns a promise if a callback function is not passed.

Params

filepath {string|Buffer|integer}: filepath or file descriptor.
data {string|Buffer|Uint8Array}: String to write to disk.
options {object}: Options to pass to fs.writeFile and/or mkdirp
callback {Function}: (optional) If no callback is provided, a promise is returned.
Example

var writeFile = require('write');
writeFile('foo.txt', 'This is content...', function(err) {
  if (err) console.log(err);
});

// promise
writeFile('foo.txt', 'This is content...')
  .then(function() {
    // do stuff
  });
.promise
The promise version of writeFile. Returns a promise.

Params

filepath {string|Buffer|integer}: filepath or file descriptor.
val {string|Buffer|Uint8Array}: String or buffer to write to disk.
options {object}: Options to pass to fs.writeFile and/or mkdirp
returns {Promise}
Example

var writeFile = require('write');
writeFile.promise('foo.txt', 'This is content...')
  .then(function() {
    // do stuff
  });
.sync
The synchronous version of writeFile. Returns undefined.

Params

filepath {string|Buffer|integer}: filepath or file descriptor.
data {string|Buffer|Uint8Array}: String or buffer to write to disk.
options {object}: Options to pass to fs.writeFileSync and/or mkdirp
returns {undefined}
Example

var writeFile = require('write');
writeFile.sync('foo.txt', 'This is content...');
.stream
Uses fs.createWriteStream to write data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists and creating any intermediate directories if they don't already exist. Data can be a string or a buffer. Returns a new WriteStream object.

Params

filepath {string|Buffer|integer}: filepath or file descriptor.
options {object}: Options to pass to mkdirp and fs.createWriteStream
returns {Stream}: Returns a new WriteStream object. (See Writable Stream).
Example

var fs = require('fs');
var writeFile = require('write');
fs.createReadStream('README.md')
  .pipe(writeFile.stream('a/b/c/other-file.md'))
  .on('close', function() {
    // do stuff
  });
