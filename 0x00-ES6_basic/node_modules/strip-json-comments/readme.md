strip-json-comments Build Status
Strip comments from JSON. Lets you use comments in your JSON files!

This is now possible:

{
	// Rainbows
	"unicorn": /* ❤ */ "cake"
}
It will replace single-line comments // and multi-line comments /**/ with whitespace. This allows JSON error positions to remain as close as possible to the original source.

Also available as a Gulp/Grunt/Broccoli plugin.

Install
$ npm install strip-json-comments
Usage
const json = `{
	// Rainbows
	"unicorn": /* ❤ */ "cake"
}`;

JSON.parse(stripJsonComments(json));
//=> {unicorn: 'cake'}
